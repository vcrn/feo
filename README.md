# FeO

FeO (feo) is a very simple system monitoring CLI tool for Linux systems written by <a href="https://github.com/vcrn">@vcrn</a>. 

FeO monitors the CPU temperature, CPU load, RAM and swap usage, and uptime. GPU temperature monitoring available for Raspberry Pi. FeO is written in Rust and inspired by the process monitoring tool htop. Named after a part of the chemical formulas for rust, with the bonus of 'feo' meaning ugly in Spanish.

For information regarding commands, like setting color scheme, update interval and GPU temperature monitoring, run
```bash
feo -h
```
