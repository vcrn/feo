FeO monitors the CPU temperature, CPU load, RAM and swap usage, and uptime. GPU temperature monitoring available for Raspberry Pi. FeO is inspired by the process monitoring tool htop, and named after a part of the chemical formulas for rust, with the bonus of 'feo' meaning ugly in Spanish.

For information regarding commands, like setting color scheme, update-delay and GPU temperature monitoring, run
```bash
feo -h
```
